## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React**
- **React libraries**
- **React Router**: For routing and navigation.
- **FontAwesome**: For icons used in the UI.
- **CSS**

### Backend

- **Express**
- **Node.js**
- **iTunes API**: Provides data for music

## Approach
We had a strong headed gameplan prior to the coding process, including drafting out a detailed wireframe of what we wanted for our app. We also utilized Trello to organize what each of us would be responsible for and what tasks we had to complete. The frontend is built using React, utilizing a component-based framework for a more responsive and interactive user experience. We created React components for various parts of the application, such as playlist management, genres, and recommended songs. React Router was used for navigating between different pages such as home, playlists, and categories. The backend is powered by Express, which handles API requests and responses. It fetches data from the iTunes API and processes user interactions such as playlist creation and song retrieval. Finally, we connected the frontend to the backend API endpoints, allowing the React application to fetch data and perform actions based on user interactions.
